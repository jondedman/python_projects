# I believe this file should deal with the following:
#   - Create a spreadsheet
#   - Delete a spreadsheet
#   - Read a spreadsheet
#   - Write to a spreadsheet
#   - Append to a spreadsheet
#   - Clear a spreadsheet

# But that is all happeing in google_sheets_client.py which sets out the methods for interacting with the Google Sheets API.
# perhaps the actual interaction with the API should be in this file, and the methods should be in google_sheets_client.py
