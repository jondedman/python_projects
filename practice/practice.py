def calculate_area(length=0, width=0):
    try:
        l = float(length)
        w = float(width)
        if l <= 0 or w <= 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return l * w
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return 0



# 2. **Data Types:**
#    - Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

def temp_converter(temp, type="c"):
    try:
        if temp == "":
            raise ValueError("Please enter a number for the temperature")
        temp = int(temp)
        type = str(type).lower()
        if type == "c":
            result = (temp * 9/5) + 32
            new_type = "f"
        elif type == "f":
            result = (temp - 32) * 5/9
            new_type = "c"
        else:
            raise ValueError("Please enter 'c' or 'f' for the type")
        return f"{result} {new_type}"
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError("Please enter a number for the temperature")

#    - Create a script that reads data from a file and handles potential file-related exceptions.

# 7. **File Handling:**
#    - Write a program that reads data from a file, processes it, and writes the results to a new file.
#    - Create a script that appends data to an existing file.

# 8. **Lists and List Comprehensions:**
#    - Implement a script that finds the largest and smallest elements in a list.
#    - Use list comprehensions to generate a list of squares from 1 to 10.

# 9. **Dictionaries:**
#    - Build a program that stores information about books in a dictionary and allows users to search for books by title or author.
#    - Create a dictionary of students' grades and calculate the average grade.

# 10. **Modules and Libraries:**
#     - Use the `random` module to simulate a dice roll.
#     - Import the `math` module to calculate the square root of a number.

# 11. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
#     - Define a class representing a basic shape with methods to calculate area and perimeter for different shapes (e.g., rectangle, circle).
#     - Create a class for a simple bank account with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.

# 12. **String Manipulation:**
#     - Write a program that reverses a given string.
#     - Implement a function to count the occurrences of a specific word in a text.

# 13. **Math and Number Operations:**
#     - Build a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers in a given range.
#     - Write a script that computes the factorial of a number using a loop.

# 14. **List Sorting and Searching:**
#     - Create a script to sort a list of numbers in ascending and descending order.
#     - Implement a binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted list.

# 15. **Recursion:**
#     - Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
#     - Create a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

# 16. **Data Structures and Algorithms:**
#     - Implement a stack or queue data structure.
#     - Write sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Quick Sort.

# 17. **Time and Date Manipulation:**
#     - Build a program that displays the current date and time.
#     - Calculate the number of days between two given dates.

# 18. **Regular Expressions:**
